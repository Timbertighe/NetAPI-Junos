# NetAPI-Junos
    The Junos plugin for Net-API

    Run junos.py to start an RPC server.
    The Net-API app will call exposed functions in this plugin, and provide credentials to connect to devices.
    Edit config.yaml in Net-API to install this plugin (loaded when the Net-API app starts)
    
    Note: This is unfinished, and still in development
